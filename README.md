# js-tepsit-project
Just Another FNaF clone. But this time, it's in JS!

Its aim is not faithfully represent the original, instead
it should just be an easier-to understand implementation.

This is the project I've presented (along with a couple friends) to
our teacher for the assignment he gave us.
